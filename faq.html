            <p><em>What platforms?</em></p>
<p>Windows, Mac, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Playstation 4, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, iOS and Android</p>
<p><em>What engine does Quest of Dungeons use?</em></p>
<p>The game was made in a custom (built in-house) engine, in C++, uses OpenGL and DirectX for render.</p>
<p><em>I found a bug</em></p>
<p>I hope it's not a game breaking one, feel free to contact describing as much as possible what happened. I'll look into as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>Does the game have multiplayer/co-op of any kind?</em></p>
<p>No, it's a single player experience. But you can take turns with your friends.</p>
<p><em>Are there any forums?</em></p>
<p>I tried having forums in the past but they are quickly outrun with spam, so for now the best place is the Quest of Dungeons <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/270050/discussions/" alt="_blank" title="Steam forums" alt="Steam Forums">Steam Community page</a>. Even if you do't have a Steam account you can read everything.</p>
<p><em>Why isn't the mobile version F2P?</em></p>
<p>Do you really want to pay each time you need a potion?</p>

<p><em>What is the release date?</em></p>
<p>It was initially released on March 25th 2014. You can buy it already. <a href="https://www.questofdungeons.com/#purchase">Go</a>...quickly, before they run out of digital copies :)</p>
<p><em>Who is making this game?</em></p>
<p>I usually go by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/DJ_Link">DJ_Link</a> on the internet. I made a couple other games, like Puwang and Vizati. I’m doing all the code for this game and some of the UI art and animations. <a href="https://twitter.com/cgbarrett">Oryx</a> did pretty much all the lovely sprite art</p>
<p><em>Steam?</em></p>
<p>The game was accepted on Steam on Jan 22nd and was released on March 25th. <strike>The game is not on steam yet but there's a greenlight campaign going on, please vote and tell your friends.</strike></p>
<p><em>But…I have more questions!</em></p>
<p>I’ll update this later. Feel free to <a href="mailto:questofdungeons@gmail.com">contact</a> me.</p>
